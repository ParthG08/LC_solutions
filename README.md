This is the directory of all the LeetCode questions that i solve my thinking process and what i do in those questions
the entire idea is to keep a documentation of the thinking process that i equip while solving on each questions so that i can look back and reflect on it easily.


Notes :-


I make a list of them seperately which is called 

"da_problems.txt":

which is the abbreviation of do_again_porblems.txt

Here i keep record of which probelms i want able to do and how many tries i needed to solve them
Something like this:

"76_Minimum_Window_Substring (2)"

also if the approach was optimal and how it compared to other solutions online
after about three tries if i am not able to solv76_Minimum_Window_Substring.cppe them then i look at the solution and mark them

"ss_problem"

something like this 

"76_Minimum_Window_Substring (ss_problem)"

so that i know that i wasnt able to solve that question and looked at the solution so that,
i know weather i can recall the solution the next time or not. The motive of this si to try to remember
the solution (thought process which is not your own), because frequently i am not able to do so.
